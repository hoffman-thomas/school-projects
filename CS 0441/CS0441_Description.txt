CS 0441 Discrete Structures for CS

The purpose of this course is to understand and use (abstract) discrete structures that are backbones of computer science. 
In particular, this class is meant to introduce logic, proofs, sets, relations, functions, counting, and probability, with an emphasis on applications in computer science.

Logic: propositional logic, logical equivalence, predicates and quantifiers, logical reasoning.
Sets: basics, set operations
Functions: one-to-one, onto, inverse, composition
Sequences and Summations
Integers: greatest common divisor, modular arithmetic
Mathematical reasoning: proof strategies, mathematical induction, recursive definitions, structural induction
Relations: properties, combining relations, closures, equivalence, partial ordering
Counting: basic rules, pigeon hole principle, permutations and combinations, binomial coefficients
Probability: Discrete probability, expected value, variance
