CS 0447 Computer Organization and Assembly Language

Computers as real, physical objects allow for the algorithms and programs we create to be utilized to solve problems. 
This course presents the concepts and implementation details necessary to explore how a computer is designed (its architecture) and works. 
We will discuss issues including representing data, building a useful set of primitive instructions (machine and assembly language) to build programs from, a real example
 of such an instruction set called MIPS, the design of electronic circuitry to do useful work, and putting together small circuits to build a working CPU.

- Understand how data can be represented and manipulated by electronic circuits.
- Write, read, and understand programs written in a low-level assembly language (MIPS)
- Design circuits that can do computations
- Construct a simple CPU that can execute instructions that perform useful work for general computation
